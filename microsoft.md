## Microsoft Technologies Commonly Used in Winning Imagine Cup Projects

This list shows the Microsoft tools that repeatedly appear in **global-winning and finalist-level projects**, along with how students actually use them.

### Cloud & Infrastructure
- **Microsoft Azure**  
  Used as the main backbone for hosting applications, APIs, AI models, and databases.

- **Azure App Service**  
  Hosts web apps and backend services quickly without managing servers.

- **Azure Functions**  
  Runs backend logic on demand (serverless), ideal for event-based workflows and automation.

- **Azure Cosmos DB**  
  Stores real-time data for AI apps, IoT solutions, chatbots, and analytics platforms.

### Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
- **Azure AI Studio**  
  Central platform for building, testing, and deploying AI-powered features.

- **Azure OpenAI Service**  
  Used for chatbots, summarization, reasoning, accessibility tools, and generative AI features.

- **Azure Cognitive Services**  
  Adds ready-made AI capabilities such as:
  - Speech-to-text and text-to-speech
  - Computer vision and image analysis
  - Language translation and sentiment analysis

- **Azure Machine Learning**  
  Trains and deploys custom ML models for prediction, classification, and detection tasks.

### Development & Productivity Tools
- **GitHub**  
  Used for version control, collaboration, and showcasing project evolution.

- **Visual Studio Code / Visual Studio**  
  Primary development environments with seamless Azure integration.

- **GitHub Copilot**  
  Speeds up coding and helps solo or small teams build faster.

### Low-Code & Automation
- **Power Apps**  
  Quickly builds MVPs or internal tools with minimal code.

- **Power Automate**  
  Automates workflows between services, APIs, and apps.

- **Power BI**  
  Visualizes data through dashboards, charts, and reports for demos and pitches.

### Security & Identity
- **Microsoft Entra (Azure Active Directory)**  
  Handles authentication, user login, and access control.

- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**  
  Adds security monitoring and compliance for cloud resources.

### Collaboration & Delivery
